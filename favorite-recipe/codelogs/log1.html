        <h1>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h1>
        <p>
            The differences between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML are purely aesthetic and functionality. Semantic tags tell the browser what is actually
            going on with the code, such as &lt;header&gt; and &lt;section&gt;, in which both tell the browser how to format the page. With non-semantic, they dont
            have a meaning, such as &lt;b&gt;, which just bolds the text, being only something visual rather than something that needs to be formatted.

        <h1>What are two or more benefits of using semantic tags?</h1>
        <p>
            Semantic tags are useful for countless things in HTML. Semantic tags are a hige resource when building a web page, it formats the photos, paragraphs,
            ordered and unordered lists, and so many other cool functions. Such as &lt;ol&gt;, it stands for ordered list, and creates bullets for everything within
            the list, making it easy to follow along to a tutorial, or just reading off of a list, obviously.So essentially, semantic tags are both helpful for 
            easy reading, and for organization.
