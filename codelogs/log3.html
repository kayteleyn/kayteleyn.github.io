        <h2>How does CSS work, and how is it useful?</h2>
        <p>CSS is a conditonal wrapper, it alters the style of the webpage by the broswer identifying and evaluating the
            code, changing the format to the CSS code. CSS is useful for many things, including adaptive layouts,
            enabling easy cellphone access, as well with more square-like monitiors. It rearranges elements and improves
            how legible the text is formatted.</p>

        <h2>What media features are supported by media queries, such as 'orrientation' and 'max-width', and what do they
            do?</h2>
        <p>Four commonly used media queries are:
        <ul>
            <li>Max-width</li>
            <li>min-width</li>
            <li>orrientation</li>
            <li>aspect-ratio</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>All of these have important roles, with max-width controlling styles when the viewport is below or at a
            certain width. Min-width, on the other hand, does the exact opposite. If the viewport is over or at a cetain
            width, it'll trigger the style. Both seem similar, however they're both used for different layouts, as
            max-width is used for mobile layouts, allowing you to shrink layouts or simplify navigation, while min-width
            is used more for desktop layouts, increasing the complexity as the screen becomes larger. Orrientation, like
            max-width, its used for mobile layouts, however orrientation is helpful for when the screen changes from
            horizontal-view to vertical-view. Orrientation specifically helps with landscape and portrait mode, allowing
            the text to not be all jumbled up when your phone flips the view to horizontal. Lastly, aspect-ratio
            identifies the size of the monitor, controlling how the scren is presented through the height and width,
            using ratios such as 16:9 and 4:3.</p>
